I am a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research AI (MSR AI), primarily working on Natural Language Generation (NLG), Deep Generative Models (DGMs), Generative Pre-training and Text Representation learning. I received Ph.D. degree and M.S. degree (Statistical Science) from Duke University in 2018, advised by Professor Lawrence Carin. Before that, I received B.Sc. degree in Physics from Nanjin University, Department for Intensive Instruction (DII), Kuang Yaming Honors school in 2011.

I am serving as one of the organization committee members in ACL 2020. I have served as a senior Program committee for AAAI 2019. I received NeurIPS 2019 top reviewer awards. 

My recent research focuses on:

- 1). Large-scale transformer-based pretraining for text.

- 2). Non-autoregressive text generation.

- 3). Adversarial attacking for NLP. 

- 4). Constraint\/controllable\/knowledge-based text generation.

- 5). Self-playing for open-domain conversational agent. 

- 6). Toxicity detection and prevention for NLG. 

- 7). Long-form text understanding/generation/reasoning.

- 8). Other interplays between deep generative models, RL, MCMC and NLP.
