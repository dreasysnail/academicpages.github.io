I am a Senior Researcher at [Microsoft Research AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-processing/) (MSR AI), primarily working on Natural Language Generation (NLG), Deep Generative Models (DGMs), Generative Pre-training and Text Representation learning. I received Ph.D. degree and M.S. degree (Statistical Science) from Duke University in 2018, advised by Professor [Lawrence Carin](http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/). Before that, I received B.Sc. degree in Physics from Nanjin University, Department for Intensive Instruction ([DII](http://dii.nju.edu.cn/kuangym/?lang=en)), Kuang Yaming Honors school in 2011.

I have served as one of the organization committee members in ACL 2020. I am an area chair in generation track for ACL 2021. I have served as a senior program committee for AAAI 2019. I received NeurIPS 2019 top reviewer awards. 

***Please send me an [email](mailto:yizzhang@microsoft.com) with your latest CV if you are a senior PhD student working on natural language generation or adversarial attacking and looking for an internship in 2021***

My recent research focuses on below topics:

- Large-scale transformer-based pretraining for text.

- Non-autoregressive text generation.

- Adversarial attacking for NLP. 

- Controllable text generation.

- Open-domain conversational agent. 

- Toxicity detection and prevention for NLG. 

- Long-form text understanding/generation/reasoning.

- Other interplays between deep generative models, RL, MCMC and NLP.
